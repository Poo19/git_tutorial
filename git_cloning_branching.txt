git clone url

git clone url <name> /* saves the files under the name folder

what cloning does

1) Downloads the entire repository into a new git-real directory

2) Add the 'origin' remote, pointing it to the clone URL

3) checks out initial branch likely master ans set the head


Branch

git branch <name> /* creates the new branch

git branch /* shows the present branch

git checkout <name> /* to move to the new branch as head and any commitments will be added to this branch 

to move back to the master type

git checkout master

MERGING

git merge <name> /* merges the <name> branch with the currenct headed branch */

now safely we can delete the <name> branch

git -d <name> 


ADMIN BRANCH

git checkout -b admin /* -b creates the branch and checks it out
